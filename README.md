# Instabug iOS Internship Program

We're excited to know that you're interested in joining the iOS team during Instabug's internship program.

The first step of our selection process is a coding task. Please follow the instructions below.

1. Clone this repo.
2. This repo contains a Swift playground. Open it and implement all the methods that are marked with **"To be implemented"**.
3. The playground implements an `Application` and a `Bug` class. The goal of the task is to be able to create some `Bug` objects, add them to an `Application`, then use `findBugs(state:timeRange:)` to filter those bugs.
4. The playground includes unit tests that run automatically and test that your code works as expected. *Only* submit your code if all tests pass.
5. When you've completed the task, add it to a GitHub repo and send us the URL.

While the playground includes tests that checks whether the implemented methods work as expected or not, your code will still be reviewed by humans. We love simple, elegant solutions that leverage Swift's powerful features.

Good luck! ü§ûüçÄ
